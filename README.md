# OrchidApiPlayer

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 18.2.2.
The generated webapp retreives one frame every five seconds from all cameras from the Orchid Core VMS server at https://orchid.ipconfigure.com.

## Developer's Notes

Much of this project involved learning on the fly. This was my first time using Angular services, unit testing in Angular, and only my second time interacting with an API.
As such, some of the code may appear over-documented. Such comments are more for me (the developer) than those more familiar with Angular.

The app is partially unit tested, but has poor test coverage.

In spite of my limited knowledge and experience, I am truly proud of what I have accomplished in this project. Creating this app has greatly increased my understanding of Angular and APIs, although I have so much more to learn and understand (especially regarding unit testing). I hope to further this knowledge with many more projects in the future.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).
